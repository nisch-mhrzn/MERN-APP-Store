# MERN Project - Admin Dashboard with Authentication and API Integration

## Project Overview

This project is a **MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js)** application that implements a role-based Admin Dashboard. It includes user management, authentication, and contact management functionalities. The project demonstrates efficient state management, secure API communication, and robust component architecture in React.

---

## Features

### Frontend:
- **React.js** with React Router for single-page navigation.
- **Role-based access control**: Only admins can access certain routes.
- **State management** using custom hooks and context (`useAuth`).
- Responsive layout and navigation using `NavLink`.
- Toast notifications for success and error handling (`react-toastify`).

### Backend:
- **Node.js** with Express for handling RESTful APIs.
- **MongoDB** for database storage.
- JWT-based authentication for secure access.
- Modular architecture with separation of controllers, routes, and middleware.
- Validation using custom validators.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Node.js installed on your machine.
- MongoDB instance running locally or remotely.

### Steps to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nisch-mahrzn/MERN-APP-Store.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd MERN-APP-Store
   ```

3. Install dependencies for both client and server:
   ```bash
   cd client
   npm install
   cd ../server
   npm install
   ```

4. Configure environment variables:
   Create a `.env` file in the `server` folder with the following variables:
   ```env
   MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/your_db_name
   JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key
   PORT=5000
   ```

5. Run the server:
   ```bash
   cd server
   npm start
   ```

6. Run the client:
   ```bash
   cd client
   npm start
   ```

## APIs

### Authentication
- `POST /api/auth/login` - Login a user and receive a JWT token.
- `POST /api/auth/register` - Register a new user.

### Contacts
- `GET /api/admin/contacts` - Fetch contact details (Admin access only).
- `DELETE /api/admin/contacts/:id` - Delete a contact by ID.

---

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React.js, React Router, React Toastify
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Authentication**: JSON Web Tokens (JWT)

---

## Challenges Faced

- Implementing **role-based routing** with React Router and handling cases where the user's role isn't loaded immediately.
- Securing API communication with JWT tokens.
- Designing reusable components for navigation and layouts.

---

## Future Improvements

- Add testing with **Jest** for both frontend and backend.
- Enhance UI with a design framework like **Material-UI** or **Bootstrap**.
- Implement pagination for user and contact lists.
